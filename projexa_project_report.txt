Chapter 2
Problem Definition and Motivation

The management of academic projects in educational institutions presents numerous challenges that affect students, faculty, and administrators alike. Traditional methods of handling project submissions, evaluations, and communications are often inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors. These limitations necessitate the development of a comprehensive digital solution that can address the complexities of modern academic project management.

The motivation for developing Projexa stems from the need to create a centralized, automated, and transparent system that enhances the academic experience while reducing administrative burden. Educational institutions require a platform that can adapt to diverse academic requirements, support multiple project phases, and provide real-time insights into student progress and performance.

2.1 Existing System

Currently, most educational institutions rely on manual or semi-automated systems for managing academic projects. These systems typically involve physical submission of documents, email-based communications, spreadsheet tracking, and manual evaluation processes. Some institutions use basic learning management systems (LMS) that lack specialized features for project management workflows.

The existing approach often involves students submitting printed reports to faculty members, who then manually evaluate submissions against predefined rubrics. Communication between students and guides typically occurs through email or in-person meetings, making it difficult to maintain consistent records and track progress effectively. Administrative tasks such as deadline management, grade compilation, and progress reporting are often handled manually using spreadsheets or basic database systems.

2.1.1 Limitations of Existing System

1. **Manual Submission Process** – Physical or email-based submissions create bottlenecks and increase the risk of lost documents or missed deadlines.

2. **Lack of Standardized Evaluation** – Without automated rubric checking, submissions may not meet required standards, leading to inconsistent evaluations.

Coding

5.1 Introduction

The coding phase represents the translation of system design specifications into functional software components. For Projexa, this involves implementing a modern web application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase, following best practices for maintainable, scalable, and secure code development.

The coding approach emphasizes modular design, type safety, and clean architecture principles. Each component is designed to be reusable, testable, and well-documented to facilitate future maintenance and feature additions. The codebase follows industry standards for formatting, naming conventions, and code organization.

5.2 Next.js

Next.js 15 with the App Router serves as the foundation for Projexa's frontend architecture. The framework provides several key advantages for academic project management:

**App Router Architecture**: The new App Router provides file-based routing with support for layouts, nested routing, and server components. This architecture enables better code organization and improved performance through server-side rendering and static generation.

**Server Components**: React Server Components allow for server-side rendering of components, reducing client-side JavaScript bundle sizes and improving initial page load times. This is particularly beneficial for dashboard pages that display large amounts of data.

**Route Handlers**: API routes are implemented as Route Handlers, providing a clean way to create backend endpoints within the Next.js application. These handlers manage authentication, data validation, and integration with Supabase services.

**Middleware**: Next.js middleware is used for authentication checks, role-based access control, and request/response modifications. This ensures that users can only access pages and resources appropriate to their role.

**Performance Optimization**: Built-in optimizations include automatic code splitting, image optimization through the next/image component, and efficient caching strategies for both static and dynamic content.

5.3 Supabase

Supabase provides a comprehensive backend-as-a-service solution that significantly accelerates development while maintaining enterprise-grade features:

**Database Management**: PostgreSQL database with automatic API generation provides both REST and GraphQL endpoints. Real-time subscriptions enable live updates for collaborative features like project status changes and notifications.

**Authentication Integration**: Supabase Auth seamlessly integrates with Next.js through the @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs package, providing secure authentication with minimal boilerplate code. Custom claims and metadata support role-based access control.

**File Storage**: Supabase Storage handles PDF file uploads with automatic virus scanning, file type validation, and access control through Row Level Security policies. Signed URLs provide secure, time-limited access to files.

**Edge Functions**: Custom business logic is implemented through Supabase Edge Functions, written in TypeScript and deployed automatically. These functions handle complex operations like rubric validation and plagiarism detection.

**Real-time Features**: Real-time subscriptions enable live updates for features like leaderboard changes, new notifications, and submission status updates without requiring page refreshes.

5.4 TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS provides a utility-first approach to styling that enables rapid development and consistent design:

**Utility Classes**: Pre-defined utility classes for spacing, colors, typography, and layout eliminate the need for custom CSS in most cases. This approach ensures consistency and reduces the overall CSS bundle size.

**Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive utilities make it easy to create interfaces that work across all device sizes. Breakpoint prefixes allow for device-specific styling without media queries.

**Component Abstraction**: While using utility classes, common patterns are abstracted into reusable components to maintain DRY principles and ensure consistency across the application.

**Custom Design System**: Tailwind's configuration allows for customization of colors, fonts, spacing scales, and other design tokens to match the academic institution's branding requirements.

**Performance**: Tailwind's purge feature removes unused styles in production, resulting in minimal CSS bundle sizes and faster page load times.
