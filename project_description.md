🧠 Project Description

**Projexa** is a comprehensive Academic Project Management System - a full-stack web application built using Next.js 15 (App Router) and Supabase to manage the complete academic project workflow in colleges and universities.

The platform serves as a centralized hub for academic project management, featuring automated workflows, intelligent plagiarism detection, rubric validation, and real-time collaboration between all stakeholders.

## 👥 User Roles

**Three distinct user types with specialized dashboards:**

**🔧 Admin** - System administrators and academic coordinators

**📚 Student** - Undergraduate/graduate students working on projects  

**👨‍🏫 Guide (Teacher)** - Faculty members supervising student projects

Each user role has unique permissions, dashboards, and workflows tailored to their specific needs in the academic project lifecycle.

👥 User Roles & Permissions
1️⃣ Admin

Belongs to a department.

Can add users (students, guides).

Can define reviews/phases (e.g., Review 1, Review 2) with:

Rubrics (like DFD, ER Diagram)

Deadlines

Max marks and late penalty/day

Can upload previous project topics (PDFs).

The system extracts text from these PDFs and stores it in DB to check for topic repetition when new projects are submitted.

Can view and edit any project or submission.

Can view a department leaderboard showing student ranks by total marks.

Can manage notifications and analytics.

2️⃣ Student

Can register a project (title, description).

The system checks topic similarity with existing topics — if unique, it’s accepted and assigned to a guide based on specialization.

Can upload PDF submissions for each review phase.

System checks PDFs for presence of required rubrics (auto validation).

If valid → accepted temporarily.

If missing → automatically rejected, email sent.

Can view:

Submission status: Accepted / Rejected / Pending

Marks and remarks per review

Leaderboard

Notifications (email + dashboard)

Receives automatic deadline reminders.

3️⃣ Guide (Teacher)

Has a specialization field.

Automatically assigned projects matching specialization.

Can view all student projects under their supervision.

Can review submissions, accept/reject, add remarks, and assign marks.

Can update or override marks before final submission closure.

🧱 Database Schema (Supabase)

Use PostgreSQL tables with these relationships:

Tables:

users (id, name, email, role, department, specialization, created_at)

projects (id, title, description, student_id, guide_id, department, status, created_at, updated_at)

phases (id, name, description, deadline, max_marks, late_penalty_per_day, department, created_by, created_at)

rubrics (id, phase_id, name, description, created_at)

submissions (id, student_id, project_id, phase_id, file_url, submission_date, rubric_check_status, guide_status, remarks, marks_awarded, late_days, created_at)

previous_topics (id, department, title, description, pdf_url, uploaded_by, created_at)

notifications (id, user_id, title, message, is_read, created_at)

leaderboard (VIEW combining submissions + users → total marks per student)

Trigger:
When a new user signs up via Supabase Auth, insert their details into users using metadata fields (name, role, department, specialization).
